#### [Mixup for Node and Graph Classification](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442381.3449796)

*Yiwei Wang, Wei Wang, Yuxuan Liang, Yujun Cai, Bryan Hooi*

*WWW 2021*

This paper proposes mixup approaches for augmenting graph data for node and graph classification. To interpolate the irregular graph topology, it proposes a two-branch graph convolution to mix the receptive field subgraphs for the paired nodes. mixup on different node pairs can interfere with the mixed features for each other due to the connectivity between nodes. To block this interference, a two-stage mixup framework was proposed by using each node’s neighbors’ representations before mixup for graph convolutions. For graph classification, it interpolates complex and diverse graphs in the semantic space.

*Benedek Rozemberczki, Peter Englert, Amol Kapoor, Martin Blais, Bryan Perozzi*

*WWW 2021*

This paper proposes the pathfinder layer, a differentiable neural network layer which is able to combine multiple sources of proximity information defined over a set of nodes to form a single weighted graph. The pathfinder layer uses a feed forward neural network to learn the edge weights while the sparsity of the underlying weighted multiplex graph is unchanged. This layer feeds directly into a downstream GNN model that is set up to learn arbitrary tasks – in this paper, semi-supervised node classification.

#### [Node2Grids: A Cost-Efficient Uncoupled Training Framework for Large-Scale Graph Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3459637.3482456)

*Dalong Yang, Chuan Chen, Youhao Zheng, Zibin Zheng, Shih-wei Liao*

*CIKM 2021*

This paper proposes a training framework that leverages the independent mapped data for obtaining the embedding. Instead of directly processing the coupled nodes, it maps the coupled graph data into independent grid-like data which can be fed into uncoupled models as CNN. To begin with, the central node is mapped to the Euclidean structured grid with the size of $k$ × 1 × 3. Then a convolutional layer is used to extract information from the grid-like data. Next, the proposed model employs attention filters to learn the weight of each grid, and fully-connected layers are finally applied to obtain the output.

#### [VQ-GNN: a universal framework to scale-up graph neural networks using vector quantization](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3540261.3540777)

*Mucong Ding, Kezhi Kong, Jingling Li, Chen Zhu, John Dickerson, Furong Huang, Tom Goldstein*

*NeurIPS 2021*

This paper proposes a framework to scale up any convolution-based GNNs using Vector Quantization (VQ) without compromising the performance. In contrast to sampling-based techniques, it is able to preserve all the messages passed in a mini-batch of nodes by learning and updating a small number of quantized reference vectors of global node representations, using VQ within each GNN layer.

*Hanqing Zeng, Muhan Zhang, Yinglong Xia, Ajitesh Srivastava, Andrey Malevich, Rajgopal Kannan, Viktor Prasanna, Long Jin, Ren Chen*

*NeurIPS 2021*

To handle the issue of oversmoothing of GNN models, this paper decouples the depth and scope of GNNs – to generate representation of a target entity by first extracting a localized subgraph as the bounded-size scope, and then applying a GNN of arbitrary depth on top of the subgraph. A properly extracted subgraph consists of a small number of critical neighbors, while excluding irrelevant ones.

*Derek Lim, Felix Hohne, Xiuyu Li, Sijia Linda Huang, Vaishnavi Gupta, Omkar Bhalerao, Ser-Nam Lim*

*NeurIPS 2021*

Graph machine learning on homophilous graphs usually assumes that nodes with similar labels are likely to connect with each other However, previous works demonstrated performance degradation on non-homophilous graphs. To address the issue, this paper first collects diverse nonhomophilous datasets from a variety of application areas to form a large non-homophilous graph. Then it proposes a simple method that admits straightforward minibatch training and inference, with superior performance.

*Jialin Wang, Xiaoru Qu, Jinze Bai, Zhao Li, Ji Zhang, Jun Gao*

*IEEE TKDE 2023*

This paper proposes a graph sampler that considers both the node connections and node attributes, thus nodes having a high influence on each other will be sampled in the same subgraph. After that, an unbiased Graph Autoencoder (GAE) with structure-level, content-level, and community-level reconstruction loss is built on the properly-sampled subgraphs in each epoch.

*Chenguang Zheng, Hongzhi Chen, Yuxuan Cheng, Zhezheng Song, Yifan Wu, Changji Li, James Cheng, Hao Yang, Shuai Zhang*

*Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, Volume 15, Issue 6, 2022*

To address the issues of existing distributed GNN training systems including high network communication cost, low CPU utilization, and poor end-to-end performance, this paper proposes ByteGNN with three key designs: (1) an abstraction of mini-batch graph sampling to support high parallelism, (2) a two-level scheduling strategy to improve resource utilization and to reduce the end-to-end GNN training time, and (3) a graph partitioning algorithm tailored for GNN workloads.

*Zihan Luo, Jianxun Lian, Hong Huang, Hai Jin, Xing Xie*

*WSDM 2022*

Instead of using a unified model to learn representations for all nodes on a large graph, this paper proposes a model-agnostic framework for scalable GNNs to improve their performance by generating personalized models at the subgroup-level. Specifically, it first applies a graph partition algorithm like METIS to divide the whole graph into multiple non-overlapped subgraphs, and tags each node with its corresponding subgraph ID as a group-wise label. Then a meta adapter is designed to learn a good global model from all subgroups and adapts to local models with a few instances in a subgraph, which helps preserve global coherence and learn local distinction.

*Lu Lin, Ethan Blaser, Hongning Wang*

*WSDM 2022*

This paper studies the property of graphs as latent hierarchical grouping of nodes, where each node manifests its membership to a specific group based on the context composed by its neighboring nodes. In each layer of the aggregation operation, a group membership is firstly sampled for each node. Then the information from neighbors is attended by the inferred membership to generate node states for the next layer. The node states for each layer are learned by recovering the context within a certain neighborhood scope. Meanwhile, inter-layer constraints are introduced to inject the inclusive relation between membership assignments across layers.

*Wentao Zhang, Yu Shen, Zheyu Lin, Yang Li, Xiaosen Li, Wen Ouyang, Yangyu Tao, Zhi Yang, Bin Cui*

*WWW 2022*

This paper summarizes a new paradigm that offers a principled approach to systemically construct the design space for scalable GNNs, rather than studying individual designs. Through deconstructing the message passing mechanism, it presents a novel Scalable Graph Neural Architecture Paradigm, together with a general architecture design space consisting of 150k different designs. Following this paradigm, it implements an auto-search engine that automatically searches well-performing and scalable GNN architectures to balance the trade-off between multiple criteria (e.g., accuracy and efficiency) via multi-objective optimization.

#### [Rethinking Node-wise Propagation for Large-scale Graph Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3589334.3645450)

*Xunkai Li, Jingyuan Ma, Zhengyu Wu, Daohan Su, Wentao Zhang, Rong-Hua Li, Guoren Wang*

*WWW 2024*

To address the issue that existing node-wise propagation optimization strategies are insufficient on web-scale graphs with intricate topology, where a full portrayal of nodes' local properties is required, this paper proposes Adaptive Topology-aware Propagation (ATP), which reduces potential high-bias propagation and extracts structural patterns of each node in a scalable manner to improve running efficiency and predictive performance. Specifically, ATP is crafted to be a plug-and-play node-wise propagation optimization strategy, allowing for offline execution independent of the graph learning process.

*Wentao Zhang, Guochen Yan, Yu Shen, Yang Ling, Yangyu Tao, Bin Cui, Jian Tang*

*SIGMOD 2024*

This paper proposes non-parametric attention (NPA), a plug-and-play module for non-parametric GNNs. To address the issue of over-smoothing, NPA introduces global attention by assigning node-adaptive attention weights to newly propagated features to measure the newly generated global information compared with the previous features. In this way, it can adaptively remove the over-smoothed and redundant feature information in each propagation step. To tackle the fixed propagation weights issue in local feature propagation, NPA further proposes local attention to consider the similarity of propagated features and assigns more attention (i.e., larger propagation weight) to similar nodes in each propagation step.

*IEEE TKDE 2023*

This paper proposes a hierarchical dynamic graph clustering network for visual feature learning. The initial graph is constructed in high-dimensional feature domain of images. To mine the hierarchical geometric features in latent graph space, adaptive clustering network (ClusterNet) is performed to learn discriminative clusters and generates cluster-based coarse graph. Then, graph convolutional networks are used to diffuse, transform and aggregate information among clusters.

This paper proposes a scalable heterogeneous inductive GNN for node classification over large imbalanced datasets, which comprises three core components: (1) a sampler based on nearest-neighbor (NN) search, (2) a heterogeneous GNN (HGNN) layer with a novel relationship aggregator, and (3) aggregator functions tailored to skewed class distributions.

*Wei-Lin Chiang, Xuanqing Liu, Si Si, Yang Li, Samy Bengio, Cho-Jui Hsieh*

*KDD 2019*

This paper proposes Cluster-GCN as an algorithm that is suitable for SGD-based training by exploiting the graph clustering structure. It works as the following: at each step, it samples a block of nodes that associate with a dense subgraph identified by a graph clustering algorithm, and restricts the neighborhood search within this subgraph. This simple but effective strategy leads to significantly improved memory and computational efficiency while being able to achieve comparable test accuracy with previous algorithms.

#### [Calibrating Graph Neural Networks from a Data-centric Perspective](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3589334.3645562)

*Cheng Yang, Chengdong Yang, Chuan Shi, Yawen Li, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jun Zhou*

*WWW 2024*

Existing calibration methods primarily focus on improving GNN models, e.g., adding regularization during training or introducing temperature scaling after training. However, this paper argues that the miscalibration of GNNs may stem from the graph data and can be alleviated through topology modification. Data observations were conducted by examining the impacts of decisive and homophilic edges on calibration performance, where decisive edges play a critical role in GNN predictions and homophilic edges connect nodes of the same class. By assigning larger weights to these edges in the adjacency matrix, an improvement in calibration performance was observed without sacrificing classification accuracy. Motivated by that, this paper proposes Data-centric Graph Calibration (DCGC), which uses two edge weighting modules to adjust the input graph for GNN calibration.

#### [Expanding the Scope: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning with Multi-Starting Progressive Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10430)

*Zhoutian Shao, Yuanning Cui, Wei Hu*

*ISWC 2024*

This paper proposes a GNN-based model for inductive knowledge graph link prediction. Specifically, it uses a pre-embedded GNN and selects a set of starting entities for the given query relation. The selected entities are categorized and added with additional links to the head entity given in the query. Then the model conducts message passing with attention mechanism, and finally decodes the target entity with an MLP over node (entity) embeddings.

#### [Efficient Topology-aware Data Augmentation for High-Degree Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05482)

*Yurui Lai, Xiaoyang Lin, Renchi Yang, Hongtao Wang*

*Technical report for the paper accepted to KDD 2024*

The message-passing paradigm of GNN brings over-smoothing and efficiency issues over high-degree graphs, where most nodes have dozens of neighbors, such as social networks, transaction graphs, power grids, etc. Additionally, such graphs usually encompass rich and complex structure semantics, which are hard to capture merely by feature aggregations in GNNs. To address these limitations, it proposes a front-mounted data augmentation framework for GNNs on HDGs, which includes two key modules: (i) feature expansion with structure embeddings, and (ii) topology- and attribute-aware graph sparsification.

#### [Mitigating Label Noise on Graph via Topological Sample Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01942)

*Yuhao Wu, Jiangchao Yao, Xiaobo Xia, Jun Yu, Ruxin Wang, Bo Han, Tongliang Liu*

*ICML 2024*

Existing approaches for sample selection over noisily labelled graph data have 2 limitations, (1) nodes located near topological class boundaries are very informative for classification but cannot be successfully distinguished by the heuristic sample selection, (2) there is no available measure that considers the graph topological information to promote sample selection in a graph. To address them, this paper proposes a Topological Sample Selection method that boosts the informative sample selection process in a graph by utilizing topological information.

This paper extends the graph pre-training framework GraphPrompt to GraphPrompt+ with two major enhancements. First, it generalizes a few graph pre-training tasks beyond simple link prediction to broaden the compatibility with the task template. Second, it designs a more generalized prompt that incorporates a series of prompt vectors within every layer of the pre-trained graph encoder.

This paper summarizes graph reinforcement learning as a decision-making method for graph combinatorial problems. The works are reviewed along the dividing line of whether the goal is to optimize graph structure given a process of interest, or to optimize the outcome of the process itself under fixed graph structure. It also discusses the common challenges facing the field and open research questions.

*IJCAI 2024 Survey*

This paper summarizes existing research efforts on Data-Efficient Graph Learning with a taxonomy of three top categories: self-supervised graph learning, semi-supervised graph learning, and few-shot graph learning. Specifically, self-supervised graph learning designs tasks that encourage the model to learn meaningful representations from the graph data itself; semi-supervised graph learning leverages the relationships within the labeled and unlabeled instances to guide the model in learning representations for unlabeled nodes or graphs; few-shot graph learning equips the model with the ability to learn from a few annotated instances and then apply this acquired knowledge to make predictions on new, unseen data.

*Tianjun Yao, Jiaqi Sun, Defu Cao, Kun Zhang, Guangyi Chen*

*TheWebConf 2024*

This paper explores the GNN-to-MLP knowledge distillation (KD) approach for the graph classification task. Compared with typical node-level classification using KD, graph classification suffers from (1) the inherent sparsity of learning signals due to soft labels being generated at the graph level, and (2) the limited expressiveness of student MLPs. To alleviate the problem, it employs a loss function composed of three distinct targets: graph-level distillation, subgraph-level distillation, and node-level distillation.

#### [Towards Robust Fidelity for Evaluating Explainability of Graph Neural Networks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=up6hr4hIQH)

*Xu Zheng, Farhad Shirani, Tianchun Wang, Wei Cheng, Zhuomin Chen, Haifeng Chen, Hua Wei, Dongsheng Luo*

*ICLR 2024*

An explanation function for GNNs takes a pre-trained GNN along with a graph as input, to produce a "sufficient statistic" subgraph with respect to the graph label in a classification task. A main challenge in studying GNN explainability is to provide fidelity measures that evaluate the performance of these explanation functions. This paper identifies shortcomings of current metrics, attributing them to the out-of-distribution nature of explanation subgraphs. To address the problem, modified fidelity metrics are proposed to transform explanation subgraphs to approximate the underlying data distribution.

This is an interesting work that tries to convert typical neural networks into a meta-structure, by taking their weights as inputs, representing them as graphs and using graph neural networks to process them. The main contribution is that of handing a much more diverse set of neural networks, and it shows good flexibility while being able to control the original network outputs by adjusting the corresponding graph meta-network.

*Jonas Seng, Matej Zečević, Devendra Singh Dhami, Kristian Kersting*

*ICLR 2024*

In DAGs, a node corresponds to a random variable and each edge marks a direct statistical dependence between two random variables. The absence of an edge encodes (in)direct independencies between random variables. The paper discusses that the optimization of a data-fitting loss can be misleading to find the DAG structure underlying the data. Basically, a root cause intervenes in the loss through its variance; and the optimization objective can thus prefer considering a root cause with high variance as an effect, than as a root cause.

To test whether networks are sampled from the same distribution, this paper evaluates two statistical metrics based on subgraph counts. The first uses empirical subgraph densities to estimate the underlying distribution, and the second converts these subgraph densities into estimates of the **graph cumulants** of the distribution. It demonstrates (theoretically and empirically) the superior performance of the graph cumulants.

*Mircea Mironenco, Patrick Forré*

*ICLR 2024*

Existing works incorporating invariance and equivariance to geometrical transformations usually focus on the case where the symmetry group employed is compact or abelian or both. This paper explores enlarged transformation groups principally through the use of Lie algebra. Specifically, it presents a framework by which it is possible to work with Lie groups 𝐺=GL+(𝑛,𝑅) and 𝐺=SL(𝑛,𝑅), as well as their representation as affine transformations 𝑅𝑛⋊𝐺. Invariant integration as well as a global parametrization is realized by decomposing the "larger" groups into subgroups and submanifolds which can be handled individually.

Focusing on the graph classification task, this paper aims to identify decision boundaries between a pair of classes, which is defined as a set of graphs having the same highest classification score for two neighboring classes. To achieve this, it first proposes an algorithm to identify pairs of classes whose decision regions are adjacent. Then for pairs of adjacent classes, the near-boundary graphs between them are effectively generated by optimizing an objective function specifically designed for boundary graph generation.

*Beatrice Bevilacqua, Moshe Eliasof, Eli Meirom, Bruno Ribeiro, Haggai Maron*

*ICLR 2024*

Subgraph GNNs are provably expressive neural architectures that learn graph representations from sets of subgraphs, despite the high computational complexity associated with message passing on many subgraphs. This paper studies the problem of selecting a small subset of subgraphs in a data-driven fashion. It first proves that there are families of WL-indistinguishable graphs for which there exist efficient subgraph selection policies: small subsets of subgraphs can already identify all the graphs within the family. Then it proposes an approach for learning how to select subgraphs in an iterative manner.

This paper studies the substructure counting ability of a type of message-passing networks, where node features are randomly initialized and the output representation is obtained by taking expectation over the randomness. Based on these representations, it proves that GNNs can learn how to count cycles, cliques, quasi-cliques, and the number of connected components in a graph.

*ICLR 2024*

This paper proposes a polynomial-expressive graph transformer model with linear complexity, which is built upon a base model that learns a high-degree polynomial on input features. To enable the base model permutation equivariant, the graph topology and node features are separately integerated, resulting in local and global equivariant attention models. Consequently, it adopts a linear local-to-global attention scheme to learn high-degree equivariant polynomials whose coefficients are controlled by attention scores.

Different from the WL-test, this paper adopts an approach to examine the expressive power of GNNs from a probabilistic perspective.

Then it investigates the problem of to what extent can GNNs approximate the inference of graphical models.

*Ziyuan Ye, Rihan Huang, Qilin Wu, Quanying Liu*

*NeurIPS 2023*

This paper proposes a post-hoc explanation framework for GNN models. Specifically, it first leverages an expansion-based Monte Carlo tree search to explore the multi-grained structure-aware connected substructure. Then the explanation results are encouraged to be informative of the graph properties by optimizing the combination of distinct single substructures. The final explanation is possible to be as explainable as the theoretically optimal explanation obtained by the Shapley value within polynomial time. *Note: Shapley value, originating from cooperative game theory, is the unique credit allocation scheme that satisfies the fairness axioms. This concept is similar to the importance scoring function for explanation with the consideration of feature interactions.*

Motivated by the well-known WL-test for measuring the expressive power of GNN models, this paper proposes Structural Encoding enhanced Global Weisfeiler-Lehman (SEG-WL) test as a generalized graph isomorphism test for the structural discriminative power of graph Transformers. With the SEG-WL test, it shows how graph Transformers’ expressive power is determined by the design of structural encodings, and presents conditions that make the expressivity of graph Transformers beyond WL-test and GNNs.

*Jiaxing Zhang, Dongsheng Luo, Hua Wei*

*KDD 2023*

Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB) is a post-hoc explanation approach that maximizes the mutual information between the target label 𝑌 and the explanation 𝐺∗ while constraining the size of the explanation as the mutual information between the original graph 𝐺 and the explanation 𝐺∗. This paper studies the distribution shifting issue in existing GIB framework that affects explanation quality. To address the issue, it introduces a generalized GIB form that includes a label-independent graph variable, which is equivalent to the vanilla GIB. With the generalized GIB, it proposes a graph mixup method with theoretical guarantee to resolve the distribution shifting issue.

*ACL 2023*

By comparing the performance of KGC models with Message-Passing (MP) or simple MLP layers, i.e., replacing the adjacency matrix of the graph with identity matrix, this paper surprisingly finds that simple MLP models are able to achieve comparable performance to MPNNs, suggesting that MP may not be as crucial as previously believed. With further exploration, it shows careful scoring function and loss function design has a much stronger influence on KGC model performance.

*KDD 2023*

This paper investigates the problem "when to pretrain models over graph data" without any usual "pretrain-finetune" attempts. Specifically, it first fits the pretraining data into graphon bases, where each element of graphon bases (i.e., a graphon) identifies a fundamental transferable pattern shared by a collection of pretraining graphs. Then the feasibility of pretraining is quantified as the generation probability of the downstream data from any generator in the generator space.

This paper studies the theoretical expressive power of order-$k$ graph transformers and sparse variants. It first shows that, an order-$k$ graph transformer without additional structural information is less expressive than the $k$-Weisfeiler Lehman ($k$-WL) test despite its high computational cost. Then it explores sparsification strategies, and shows that a natural neighborhood-based sparse order-$k$ transformer model is not only computationally efficient, but also expressive – as expressive as $k$-WL test.

*WWW 2024*

This paper investigates the global interpretation for GNN models, whose goal is to generate a few compact interpretive graphs to summarize class discriminative patterns the GNN model learns for decision making. It assumes that if the interpretation indeed contains essential patterns the model captures during training, then if use these interpretive graphs to train a model from scratch, this surrogate model should present similar behavior as the original model. Based on this, it proposes a new metric as model fidelity, which evaluates the predictive similarity between the surrogate model (trained via interpretative graphs) and the original model (normally trained via the training set). Then it also proposes a global interpretable graph learning model that can provide graph patterns as global interpretation during training.

The presence of relational hyperedges makes link prediction a task between $k$ nodes for varying choices of $k$, which is substantially harder than link prediction with knowledge graphs, where every relation is binary ($k = 2$). This paper proposes two frameworks for link prediction with relational hypergraphs and conduct analysis of the expressive power of the resulting model architectures via corresponding relational Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithms.

*Sravanthi Gurugubelli, Sundeep Prabhakar Chepuri*

*ICLR 2024 Spotlight*

Simplicial neural networks (SNNs) are deep models for higher-order graph representation learning that learn low-dimensional embeddings of simplices in a simplicial complex by aggregating features of their respective upper, lower, boundary, and coboundary adjacent simplices. This paper proposes a scalable simplicial-aware neural network (SaNN) model with a constant run-time and memory requirements independent of the size of the simplicial complex and the density of interactions in it. SaNN is based on pre-aggregated simplicial-aware features as inputs to a neural network, thus having a strong simplicial-structural inductive bias.

To address these issues, it proposes an effective GNN training framework by excluding edges which are incident to low-degree nodes in the training/test time, thus improving the accuracy especially for sparse graphs.

Given the situation that graph tasks with node level, edge level, and graph level are far diversified, making the pre-training pretext often incompatible with these multiple tasks, this paper proposes a multi-task prompting method for graph models. Specifically, it first unifies the format of graph prompts and language prompts with the prompt token, token structure, and inserting pattern.  To narrow the gap between various graph tasks and pre-training strategies, it reformulates downstream problems to the graph-level task, and introduces meta-learning to efficiently learn a better initialization for the multi-task prompt of graphs.

This paper investigates the problem of what information is essentially encoded into the learned representations by graph contrastive learning (GCL). It answers the question by establishing connections between GCL and graph spectrum. It finds that the difference of the high-frequency parts between two augmented graphs should be larger than that of low-frequency parts, and the learned representations by GCL essentially encode the low-frequency information. Based on these, it proposes a general GCL plug-in module which further improves the existing GCL performance.

Unlike typical graph generative models which represent the graph into continuous space, this paper introduces DiGress as a discrete denoising diffusion model for generating graphs with categorical node and edge attributes. It utilizes a discrete diffusion process that progressively edits graphs with noise, through the process of adding or removing edges and changing the categories. A graph transformer network is trained to revert this process, simplifying the problem of distribution learning over graphs into a sequence of node and edge classification tasks.

To combine the generation process of nodes and edges in graph generation instead of conducting them in parallel, this paper takes the VGAE (variational graph auto-encoders) structure and uses a score-based generative model (SGM) as a flexible prior to sample node vectors. By modeling only node vectors in the latent space, NVDiff significantly reduces the dimension of the diffusion process and thus improves sampling speed.

*ICML 2023*

To address the uncontrollable convergence rate caused by correlations across nodes in the underlying dimensional signal-generating space, this paper proposes to use Wasserstein bary centers as graph-level consensus to combat node-level correlations. Specifically, it proposes a Wasserstein bary center matching (WBM) layer that represents an input graph by Wasserstein distances between its MPNN-filtered node embeddings versus some learned class-wise bary centers. Theoretically, it shows that the convergence rate of an MPNN with a WBM layer is controllable and independent to the dimensionality of the signal-generating space.

This paper studies the generalization error of MPNNs in graph classification and regression. By assuming that graphs of different classes are sampled from different random graph models, it shows that, when training a MPNN on a dataset sampled from such a distribution, the generalization gap increases in the complexity of the MPNN, and decreases, not only with respect to the number of training samples, but also with the average number of nodes in the graphs. This shows how a MPNN with high complexity can generalize from a small dataset of graphs, as long as the graphs are large.

To minimize the distributional gap between training data and real-world data in applications, typical graph domain adaptation (gda) methods aligning the distributions of node representations output by a single GNN encoder shared across the training and testing domains, which yields sub-optimal performance. This paper first identifies a type of distributional shift of node attributes and demonstrates that existing GDA methods are sub-optimal for this shift, and then proposes a structural re-weighting scheme to address this issue.

*Chaitanya K. Joshi, Cristian Bodnar, Simon V. Mathis, Taco Cohen, Pietro Lio*

*ICML 2023*

This paper proposes a geometric version of the WL test for discriminating geometric graphs embedded in Euclidean space. It concludes that (1) Invariant layers have limited expressivity as they cannot distinguish one-hop identical geometric graphs; (2) Equivariant layers distinguish a larger class of graphs by propagating geometric information beyond local neighbourhoods; (3) Higher order tensors and scalarisation enable maximally powerful geometric GNNs; and (4) GWL’s discrimination-based perspective is equivalent to universal approximation.

*Bohang Zhang, Shengjie Luo, Shengjie Luo, Liwei Wang, Di He*

*ICLR 2023 Best Paper*

This paper investigates the ability of GNNs to identify the biconnectivity of graphs as a measure of their expressive power. Unlike the well-known WL test being an upper-bound of GNNs' expressive power, the problem of graph biconnectivity is easy to solve in practice. However, most of existing GNN models are unable to even identify whether or not a given graph contains a cut vertex or cut edge. Motivated by this, this paper analyzes a special kind of GNN, named Equivariant Subgraph Aggregation Network (ESAN), which is being able to identify the graph biconnectivity. It further proposes a framework called Generalized Distance Weisfeiler-Lehman (GD-WL) test, as an advanced method to test the GNN's expressive power.

*Yushun Dong, Song Wang, Yu Wang, Tyler Derr, Jundong Li*

*KDD 2022*

This paper studies the structural explanation of bias in node prediction for GNN. It formulates the problem as to identify a set of edges in the computation graph which mainly accounts for the bias of a given node (binary) prediction, as well as a set of edges which accounts for the fairness. It measures the extent of bias/fairness given by the set of edges as distances (specifically, Wasserstein distance) between the probabilistic distributions. The core idea is the edges in the bias edge set maximally account for the node-level bias, while those in the fairness edge set maximally alleviates the node-level bias.

This paper proposes a graph continual learning model for the task of node classification. It consists of a reinforcement learning based controller to manage adding and deleting node features, and a GNN as child network to deal with the tasks. It supports both task-incremental and class-incremental settings for node classification.

This paper proposes a GNN model to generate subgraphs as explanation for the graph classification task based on factual and counterfactual reasoning. It proposes two objectives that a good explanation should be (1) sufficient and necessary (related to factual and counterfactual reasoning), and (2) simple (driven by the Occam’s Razor Principle).

*TheWebConf 2022*

This paper proposes an idea that the graph structure modeling is unimportant for GCN-based KGC models. Instead, the ability to distinguish different entities and the transformations for entity embeddings account for the performance improvements. To prove this, firstly, it randomly changes the adjacency tensors in message passing and surprisingly gets similar results. Besides, removing the self-loop information also results in similar performance. Based on that, this paper also proposes a KG embedding model which applies linear transformation to entity representations.

*TheWebConf 2022*

This paper proposes a knowledge graph reasoning network named RED-GNN to answer the queries in the form of $\langle$ subject entity, relation, ? $\rangle$. It introduces a relational directed graph (r-digraph) to capture the entity relation connections in the KG, and uses dynamic programming to recursively encode multiple r-digraphs with shared edges. It achieves relatively good performance among existing GNN models, and provides their codes.

*TheWebConf 2022*

This paper studies a problem of user-user interaction recommendation in emerging scenarios, which is formulated as a few-shot link prediction task over a multiplex graph. To solve the problem, it proposes a model containing two levels of attention mechanism. Each of the several experts is trained on one type of edges (i.e., learns the attention over each type of edges), while different scenarios choose different combination of experts (i.e., learn the attention over experts).

This paper focuses on the task of knowledge graph completion. While existing GNN models for knowledge graph completion generally use transductive features of the KG and cannot handle unseen entities during the test phase, this paper improves the GCN model to address the problem by changing the encoder and decoder components. Each node in this GNN model is designed to represent a pair of entities in the original KG. Besides, its transparent nature allows the predicted triples to be read out directly without the need of an additional predicting layer.

*Arxiv 2022*

A survey about GNNs for heterophilic graphs. Generally, most existing GNN models depends on the homophily assumption, i.e., the nodes with same or similar labels are more likely to be linked than those with different labels, such as the citation network. But there are also many real-world graphs do not obey this rule, e.g., online transaction networks, dating networks. This paper surveys existing research efforts for GNNs over heterophilic graphs in two folds: (1) non-local neighbor extension, which try to obtain information from similar but distant nodes (2) GNN architecture refinement, which try to modify the information aggregation methods on the model side. This paper has also suggested 4 future work directions: (1) interpretability and robustness, (2) scalable heterophilic GNNs (how to implement large models, how to train, how to sample batches), (3) heterophily and over-smoothing, (4) comprehensive benchmark and metrics (real-world, larger graphs).

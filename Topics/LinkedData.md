I've read this paper when preparing the submission to theWebConf'21, at that time we wanted to implement some quality measurements for each dataset, to improve the re-ranking performance for the retrieved result datasets. Intuitively it was because "Relying only on links mined from metadata is far from enough, incorporating the content can add some links, but still not enough. So we needed some quality measurements to help improve ranking as a complement." For this paper, it indeed provides various metrics from 4 aspects, include: (1) accessibility, e.g., availability, licensing, (2) intrinsic dimensions, which mainly related to semantic accuracy and schema consistency, (3) contextual dimensions, which mainly related to the contextual task or user satisfactory, e.g., trustworthiness, understandability, timeliness, (4) representational dimensions, measuring if the dataset is typical and usable, e.g., w/ or w/o multi-language version. Besides, this paper also illustrates the relations between the 4 kinds of dimensions, and provides a comparison among all surveyed papers and tools of all the summarized quality dimensions.

This paper considers the semantics of the KB in terms of special instances that involve equivalence classes of entities and sets of values, where the former collect entities denoting the same real-world object, and the latter collect all alternative values of an attribute. Then it designs a chase procedure that terminates with the answers to conjunctive queries.

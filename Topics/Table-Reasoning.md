This work proposes a plug-and-play framework to enhance trajectory search via lightweight, training-free reward modeling by formulating the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. Providing explicit verifiable rewards during State Transition (*What is the best action?*) and Simulative Reasoning (*Am I sure about the output?*) is crucial to steer the agent's navigation in table states. By enforcing stepwise reasoning with reward feedback in table transformations, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in TableQA with almost 25\% drop in inference cost.

#### [Beyond Linearization: Attributed Table Graphs for Table Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08444)

*Arxiv 2026*

This work proposes Table Graph Reasoner (TABGR), a training-free model that represents tables as an Attributed Table Graph (ATG). The ATG explicitly preserves row-column-cell structures while enabling graph-based reasoning for explainability. It further proposes a Question-Guided Personalized PageRank (QG-PPR) mechanism to rerank tabular data and mitigate the lost-in-the-middle issue.

This paper proposes an embedding-based neural network model for link prediction over hypergraphs. Specifically, it extends the idea of convolutional neural network, using a 3D convolution to capture the interactions of entities and relations to extract explicit and implicit knowledge in each n-ary fact without compromising the translation property. Additionally, appropriate relation and position-aware filters are utilized sequentially to perform two-dimensional convolution operations to capture the intrinsic patterns and position information in each n-ary fact, respectively.

This paper extends the GCN framework to hypergraphs as HyperGCN. It is evaluated over citation/coauthoring hypergraph cora/citeceer, though the model ignores the hyperedge labels.

This paper proposes a message passing neural network framework named Generalized-MPNN for multi-relational hypergraphs, and an extension MPNN-R (MPNN-Recursive) to handle recursively-structured data. Besides, it proposes three datasets for the inductive hyper-link prediction task.

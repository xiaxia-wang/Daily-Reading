This paper extends the GCN framework to hypergraphs as HyperGCN. It is evaluated over citation/coauthoring hypergraph cora/citeceer, though the model ignores the hyperedge labels.

This paper proposes a message passing neural network framework named Generalized-MPNN for multi-relational hypergraphs, and an extension MPNN-R (MPNN-Recursive) to handle recursively-structured data. Besides, it proposes three datasets for the inductive hyper-link prediction task.

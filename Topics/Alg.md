#### [Fast Matching for All Pairs Similarity Search](https://doi.org/10.1109/WI-IAT.2009.52)

This paper proposes a general framework for all-pairs similarity search which contains 3 main steps, i.e., data preprocessing, pairs matching, and indexing. It optimizes the matching step by incorporating (1) a lower bound on the number of non-zero components in any record, (2) a upper bound on the similarity score for any record pair. The detailed algorithm and the upper/lower bounds are also presented in the paper.

This paper proposes PPJOIN, an efficient set similarity join approach. For a given similarity threshold and a list of records ranked by length and dictionary (for Jaccard similarity), it iterates over the records, filters them by prefixes, and verifies the exact similarity of a few candidates. It also incorporates a map-based optimization for the verification process.

#### [Efficient Set Similarity Joins Using Min-prefixes](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-03973-7_8)

This paper proposes a new approach for set similarity join. Unlike existing methods focusing on efficiently pruning the number of candidate sets, it achieves a trade-off between the cost of candidate generation and the verification phase. The workload for verification is increased while the computational cost for candidate generation is decreased, i.e., the length of prefixes is decreased. It modifies the SOTA similarity join method PPJOIN with minimal length of the prefixes to construct the inverted index. The proposed method is thus named MPJOIN.

#### [Efficient set joins on similarity predicates](https://doi.org/10.1145/1007568.1007652)

*Sunita Sarawagi, Alok Kirpal*

*SIGMOD 2004*

This paper proposes an optimized similarity join method based on existing algorithms and inverted indexes. Here, the predicates mean similarity measurements, such as set intersect, Jaccard coefficient or cosine similarity. The task is formulated as finding all pairs of word sets for which the total weight of common words exceeds the threshold. The approach begins by building an inverted index, then ranking the retrieved set list using a heap. Besides, it also adds a clustering step for related sets to further optimize the search space and memory cost.

This paper proposes a precise algorithm named PartEnum for set similarity joins. It firstly generates signatures for the input sets, and finds all the pairs of sets with signatures overlap. Based on the overlap of signatures, it outputs all the final similar pairs as the result. The signature is like a compression of the original vector to speed up the comparison. This paper also proposes an evaluation framework for the performance of set similarity join methods.

#### [A Primitive Operator for Similarity Joins in Data Cleaning](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2006.9)

*Surajit Chaudhuri, Venkatesh Ganti, Raghav Kaushik*

*ICDE 2006*

This paper proposes SSJOIN, a primitive operator for set similarity join. SSJOIN can support different kinds of similarity measures such as edit distance, Jaccard similarity, co-occurrence. Apart from the examples given in the paper, it proposes implementing details and the comparison with existing similarity join methods.

This paper proposes a precise algorithm named PartEnum for set similarity joins. It firstly generates signatures for the input sets, and finds all the pairs of sets with signatures overlap. Based on the overlap of signatures, it outputs all the final similar pairs as the result. The signature is like a compression of the original vector to speed up the comparison. This paper also proposes an evaluation framework for the performance of set similarity join methods.

This paper proposes SSJOIN, a primitive operator for set similarity join. SSJOIN can support different kinds of similarity measures such as edit distance, Jaccard similarity, co-occurrence. Apart from the examples given in the paper, it proposes implementing details and the comparison with existing similarity join methods.

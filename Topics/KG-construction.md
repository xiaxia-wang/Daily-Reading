This paper proposes an entity alignment model based on fewer training data and multiple aligners with cycle-teaching. It firstly implements a diversity-aware alignment selection for the seeding training data. Then it computes an optimal order of the aligners to pass on the new alignments. It also designs a conflict resolution strategy to resolve the conflicts between the aligner and its predecessor.

This paper focuses on capturing informative negations about concepts in commonsense knowledge bases. Since general commonsense knowledge bases hold an open-world assumption, they cannot answer the questions (i.e., unknown) related to absent triples in the KB. In this paper, for a given target concept, a set of comparable (similar) concepts are firstly extracted, then a local closed-world assumption is applied to compute the negative relations. Then these negative candidates are scrutinized over the input KB using sentence embeddings, and also evaluated over a external PLM. Finally, the most informative negations are selected as the result.

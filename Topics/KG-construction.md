This paper focuses on capturing informative negations about concepts in commonsense knowledge bases. Since general commonsense knowledge bases hold an open-world assumption, they cannot answer the questions (i.e., unknown) related to absent triples in the KB. In this paper, for a given target concept, a set of comparable (similar) concepts are firstly extracted, then a local closed-world assumption is applied to compute the negative relations. Then these negative candidates are scrutinized over the input KB using sentence embeddings, and also evaluated over a external PLM. Finally, the most informative negations are selected as the result.

This paper conducts an exploratory research about visual data communication, especially their sensemaking behaviors. By analyzing a corpus of public science magazines over several decades, it divides the methodological process of visual data communication by different perspectives, and develops a code book for existing topologies for chart classification, visualization tasks and types of data encoding. It further discusses the roles of different ways to convey messages.

*CHI 2023*

*This paper receives a best-paper honorable mention in CHI 2023.* It proposes a comprehensive taxonomy for human-AI collaborative processes, which consists of tree-structured artifacts. The properties of these artifacts are further delineated according to a hierarchical set of dimensions, categories, and characteristics.

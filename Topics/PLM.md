This paper proposes to use ontology information to enhance prompt-tuning in few-shot learning tasks. It evaluates three tasks including relation extraction, event extraction and knowledge graph completion in this paper. The ontology information of target entities used in this paper is extracted from the knowledge graph, and used as plain texts as auxiliary prompts for PLM.

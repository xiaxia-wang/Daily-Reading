This paper proposes an explainable neural rule learning method for binary predictions. It constructs a set of explainable condition modules (ECMs) as units of the neural network, and organizes them into a forest (multiple trees). From each root to the leaves, a path is greedily identified. Then the final prediction is given by a voting layer with different weights of the trees.

This paper proposes a neural-symbolic approach for the task of machine reading comprehension. For a given document, it firstly applies symbolic reasoning to extend the existing text logic graph. Then it adopts neural reasoning with a subgraph-to-node message passing mechanism to predict the answer for multiple-choice questions.

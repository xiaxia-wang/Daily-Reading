This paper proposes a neural-symbolic approach for the task of machine reading comprehension. For a given document, it firstly applies symbolic reasoning to extend the existing text logic graph. Then it adopts neural reasoning with a subgraph-to-node message passing mechanism to predict the answer for multiple-choice questions.

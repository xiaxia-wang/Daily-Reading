This paper proposes a transformation of knowledge graphs to GNN, in which the predictions can be interpreted symbolically as Datalog rules. It firstly introduces the transformation of a KG to a GNN, in which each entity and relation is represented by a vertex, and coloured edges represent different roles. Then it proves that, such a monotonic graph neural network (MGNN) can equally derive a set of facts as a set of Datalog rules, and an operator on the MGNN can also be mapped to a symbolic rule or program.

#### [Neuro-Symbolic Interpretable Collaborative Filtering for Attribute-based Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3485447.3512042)

This paper proposes a neural-symbolic approach for attribute-based recommendation. The goal of the task is to predict the user-item interaction based on their attribute-value pairs. It proposes a three-tower shaped model, in which the three towers represent the user, item, and the concatenation of user and item. It incorporates logical layers in each tower with conjunction and disjunction nodes.

This paper proposes an explainable neural rule learning method for binary predictions. It constructs a set of explainable condition modules (ECMs) as units of the neural network, and organizes them into a forest (multiple trees). From each root to the leaves, a path is greedily identified. Then the final prediction is given by a voting layer with different weights of the trees.

#### [AdaLoGN: Adaptive Logic Graph Network for Reasoning-Based Machine Reading Comprehension](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-long.494)

This paper proposes a neural-symbolic approach for the task of machine reading comprehension. For a given document, it firstly applies symbolic reasoning to extend the existing text logic graph. Then it adopts neural reasoning with a subgraph-to-node message passing mechanism to predict the answer for multiple-choice questions.

This paper proposes a dataset named FinQA containing question-answer pairs with annotated reasoning explanations based on financial reports. By implementing existing QA methods as baseline, the experimental results suggest existing pre-trained language models still fall far short than humans in acquiring finance knowledge and conducting multi-step numerical reasoning.

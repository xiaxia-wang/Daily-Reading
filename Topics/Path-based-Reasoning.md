This paper proposes a path-based reasoning model for knowledge graph completion. It assumes that each relation between a pair of query entities can be represented by a "latent" path in the graph. Therefore, it combines a CNN-based path reasoner with an LSTM-based path finder in the model. It also takes negative samples into the training process.

This paper applies a reinforcement learning method to select the most promising relation over the knowledge graph for extending the reasoning path. The selection is embedding-based, which takes accuracy, diversity, and efficiency into consideration.

This paper also investigates the problem of path-based rule learning. Instead of using a refinement operator to search the rule space, it applies embedding models to effectively prune the search. Specifically, for a given rule head, it firstly samples a small part from the original KG containing only entities and relations related to the rule head. Then it performs rule search over the embedded subgraph with rule evaluation for instant pruning the search space.

This paper proposes a path-based reasoning model for knowledge graph completion. It assumes that each relation between a pair of query entities can be represented by a "latent" path in the graph. Therefore, it combines a CNN-based path reasoner with an LSTM-based path finder in the model. It also takes negative samples into the training process.

This paper applies a reinforcement learning method to select the most promising relation over the knowledge graph for extending the reasoning path. The selection is embedding-based, which takes accuracy, diversity, and efficiency into consideration.

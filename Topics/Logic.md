This paper introduces the foundation of inductive logic programming. It begins with introducing induction. Then it reviews existing ILP systems with theoretical foundations, such as the relations to PAC-learning. It further analyzes the relationship between inverse resolution (IR) and relative least general generalization (RLCG), as well as the feasibility of extending the RLGG framework to allow for the invention of new predicates.

*AAAI 2023*

This paper proposes a fact entailment checking method for an extension of Datalog of predicates/concepts satisfiability with time intervals. The reasoning process is based on forward-chaining and captures repeating patterns between continuous time intervals to block infinite expansion. After obtaining all the available patterns the algorithm is ensured to terminate and is able to return all possible entailment results.

This paper proposes a rule learning method over knowledge graphs for link prediction. Its motivation includes that, firstly, most of existing rule learning methods rely on the rule instances appear in the datasets, and secondly, existing methods typically regard the learned rules as independent with each other, instead of in a deductive manner. To address the first limitation, this paper proposes a probabilistic measurement based on the conditional probability to evaluate each rule. For the second limitation, it also learns the probabilistic to replace a continuous pair of relations with a single relation for recursively reducing the relation path. The rules learned in this paper are represented as Horn rules.

#### [Inductive Logic Programming](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03037089)

This paper introduces the foundation of inductive logic programming. It begins with introducing induction. Then it reviews existing ILP systems with theoretical foundations, such as the relations to PAC-learning. It further analyzes the relationship between inverse resolution (IR) and relative least general generalization (RLCG), as well as the feasibility of extending the RLGG framework to allow for the invention of new predicates.

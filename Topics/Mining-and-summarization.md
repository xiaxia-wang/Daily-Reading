This paper proposes a weakly-supervised model for target-oriented, fine-grained opinion summarization, which includes (1) extracting candidate opinion phrases by identifying objects and associated description from the raw corpus, (2) identifying possible aspect and sentiment in each candidate phrase, and (3) aggregating phrases within each aspect and sentiment to obtain fine-grained opinion clusters.

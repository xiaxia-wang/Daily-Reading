This paper proposes an efficient and scalable near-duplicate sequence search algorithm at scale for LM training corpus, which can be applied to evaluate the training data memorization by the model. The algorithm generates and groups the min-hash values for all sequences with at least t tokens in the corpus within reasonable time, then it searches for all sequences sharing enough min-hash values with the query using inverted indexes and prefix filtering.

This paper proposes a weakly-supervised model for target-oriented, fine-grained opinion summarization, which includes (1) extracting candidate opinion phrases by identifying objects and associated description from the raw corpus, (2) identifying possible aspect and sentiment in each candidate phrase, and (3) aggregating phrases within each aspect and sentiment to obtain fine-grained opinion clusters.

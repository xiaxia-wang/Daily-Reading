This is another interesting but different paper from the last one, mainly with a different focus on Web 3.0 instead of Web3. It similarly introduces major techniques in Web 3.0, including the Semantic Web, AI, Blockchain, decentralized storage and edge computing. Specifically, it also uses a section to compare Web 3.0 and Web3. Both of them are extensions of the Semantic Web. "Web 3.0 is a web-based on smart input terminals. The distributed system is largely its core idea and then implements a decentralized network, but Web3 is more about decentralized governance with blockchain technology."

This paper provides a comprehensive overview to the progress of so-called Web3 so far. It introduces several core technologies appear and are used in Web3, which are mainly related to data storage, communication networks and computing. It also describes the difference between Web 3.0 and Web3, as "Web 3.0 [47], also known as the semantic web, focuses more on efficiency and intelligence by reusing and linking data across websites. Whatâ€™s more, Web3 puts a strong focus on security and returns data ownership back to users."

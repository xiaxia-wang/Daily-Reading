#### [Advancing Molecule Invariant Representation via Privileged Substructure Identification](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3637528.3671886)

*Ruijia Wang, Haoran Dai, Cheng Yang, Le Song, Chuan Shi*

*KDD 2024*

This paper proposes a specific framework for molecule invariant representation. It first formalizes molecule invariant learning based on privileged substructure identification and introduces substructure invariance constraint. Building on that, it theoretically establishes two criteria for environment splits conducive to molecule invariant learning. Inspired by the criteria, a dual-head graph neural network is developed with a shared identifier that identifies privileged substructures, while environment and task heads generates predictions based on variant and privileged substructures.

#### [Do We Really Need Graph Convolution During Training? Light Post-Training Graph-ODE for Efficient Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18910)

*Weizhi Zhang, Liangwei Yang, Zihe Song, Henry Peng Zou, Ke Xu, Liancheng Fang, Philip S. Yu*

*CIKM 2024*

This paper claims a new idea that the graph convolution layers are less effective in the training stage than the testing stage for recommendation task, and then proposes a framework that directly optimizes the embedding alignment (for the paired nodes) in the training process, while only applying the graph convolution layers in the testing process. The results indicate that by doing so, the training time could be largely reduced without sacrificing the overall performance.

#### [PolygonGNN: Representation Learning for Polygonal Geometries with Heterogeneous Visibility Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00742)

*Dazhou Yu, Yuntong Hu, Yun Li, Liang Zhao*

*KDD 2024*

To effectively capture and utilize the representation of multipolygons, this paper first proposes a unified representation framework as heterogeneous visibility graph for single and multipolygons. Then, to enhance computational efficiency and minimize graph redundancy, it implements a heterogeneous spanning tree sampling method. Additionally, it devises a rotation-translation invariant geometric representation to ensure broader applicability across scenarios. Finally, it proposes a model Multipolygon-GNN to leverage the spatial and semantic heterogeneity inherent in the visibility graph.

#### [Unifying Graph Retrieval and Prompt Tuning for Graph-Grounded Text Classification](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626772.3657934)

*Le Dai, Yu Yin, Enhong Chen, Hui Xiong*

*SIGIR 2024 Short*

For the document classification task where documents are represented as nodes in a graph, unlike existing approaches typically applying GNN for classification by using the document as context, this paper proposes a prompt tuning based approach that searches on the graph and generates node-based and path-based contexts for document classification.

#### [Graph Reasoning Enhanced Language Models for Text-to-SQL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626772.3657961)

*Zheng Gong, Ying Sun*

*SIGIR 2024 Short*

Existing Text-to-SQL approaches typically introduce some useful multi-hop structures manually and then incorporate them into graph neural networks by stacking multiple layers, which (1) ignore the difficult-to-identify but meaningful semantics embedded in the multi-hop reasoning path, and (2) are limited by the expressive capability of GNN to capture long-range dependencies among the heterogeneous graph. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes a graph reasoning enhanced language model, which applies structure encoding to capture the dependencies between node pairs, encompassing one-hop, multi-hop and distance information, subsequently enriched through self-attention for enhanced representational power over GNNs.

*Xuexiong Luo, Jia Wu, Jian Yang, Shan Xue, Amin Beheshti, Quan Z. Sheng, David McAlpine, Paul Sowman, Alexis Giral, Philip S. Yu*

*IJCAI 2024 Survey*

A novel approach in neuroimaging has emerged that models the human brain as a graph-structured pattern, with different brain regions represented as nodes and functional relationships among these regions as edges. This paper reviews GNN-based approaches for learning brain graph representations. It first introduces the process of brain graph modeling based on common neuroimaging data, and then systematically categorizes current works into static-, dynamic-, and multi-modal brain graphs with their targeted research problems. Also, it summarizes existing available datasets and resources.

#### [Leveraging Pedagogical Theories to Understand Student Learning Process with Graph-based Reasonable Knowledge Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12896)

*Jiajun Cui, Hong Qian, Bo Jiang, Wei Zhang*

*KDD 2024*

Knowledge tracing (KT) focuses on predicting students' performance on given questions to trace their evolving knowledge. This paper utilizes the educational theory and divides the KT process into 3 stages, (1) knowledge retrieval, (2) memory strengthening, and (3) knowledge learning/forgetting. By applying a GNN model over a knowledge concept graph for predicting (binary) answers for anchor questions, the three-stage modeling is recurrent along the student response sequence. After learning/forgetting knowledge in the third stage, the updated knowledge memory is prepared for the first stage to answer the next question.

*Mingdai Yang, Zhiwei Liu, Liangwei Yang, Xiaolong Liu, Chen Wang, Hao Peng, Philip S. Yu*

*WSDM 2024*

This paper proposes a multitask pretraining model for recommendation. It introduces task hypergraphs for different pretext recommendation tasks, and applies a transitional attention layer to discriminatively learn from each task. The trainable parameters are only the initial user and item embeddings, while the hypergraph embeddings are conducted in a standard way of matrix factorization.

#### [KGTrust: Evaluating Trustworthiness of SIoT via Knowledge Enhanced Graph Neural Networks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583549)

*Zhizhi Yu, Di Jin, Cuiying Huo, Zhiqiang Wang, Xiulong Liu, Heng Qi, Jia Wu, Lingfei Wu*

*WWW 2023*

Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is an emerging paradigm that injects the notion of social networking into smart objects, i.e., things. To better utilize the various information provided in SIoT, this paper proposes a knowledge-enhanced GNN model for trust evaluation. It first extracts useful knowledge from usersâ€™ comment behaviors and external structured triples related to object descriptions, and further introduces a discriminative convolutional layer that utilizes heterogeneous graph structure, node semantics, and augmented trust relationships to learn node embeddings from the perspective of a user as a trustor or a trustee.

*WSDM 2023*

Typical user-item correlations in e-commerce are modeled as bipartite graph for downstreaming tasks. To address the challenges of (1) long-tail distribution, and (2) disassortative mixing (i.e., infrequently queries are more likely to link to popular items), this paper models the user-item correlations as a hypergraph, where all items appear in the same customer session are treated as a single hypernode. An attention-based model is proposed to use information from both the original query-item edges and item-item hyperedges.

#### [Enabling tabular deep learning when dâ‰«n with an auxiliary knowledge graph](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04766.pdf)

*Camilo Ruiz, Hongyu Ren, Kexin Huang, Jure Leskovec*

*Arxiv 2023*

To overcome the problem of overfitting in tabular data with extremely high d-dimensional features but limited n samples (i.e. d â‰« n), this paper uses an auxiliary KG describing input features to regularize a MLP. Each input feature corresponds to a node in the auxiliary KG. It is based on the inductive bias that two input features corresponding to similar nodes in the auxiliary KG should have similar weight vectors in the MLPâ€™s first layer.

#### [Faithful Knowledge Graph Explanations in Commonsense Question Answering](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.743/)

*Guy Aglionby, Simone Teufel*

*EMNLP 2022*

For commonsense QA, this paper argues that faithful graph-based explanations cannot be extracted from a kind of typical models that combine a text encoder with a graph encoder, mainly due to the text encoder separately conducts reasoning. Motivated by this, it presents two empirical changes to the model, which results in the increase of reasoning proportion done by the graph encoder, thus "increasing the explanation faithfulness".

#### [Addressing Variable Dependency in GNN-based SAT Solving](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08738.pdf)

*Zhiyuan Yan, Min Li, Zhengyuan Shi, Wenjie Zhang, Yingcong Chen, Hongce Zhang*

*Arxiv 2023*

This paper proposes a new GNN-based architecture for predicting a satisfiable boolean assignment for a given CNF formula. Notice that some previous work cannot handle a kind of CNFs which have symmetric variables and asymmetric values (e.g., a XOR b), this paper incorporates recurrent neural networks, specifically, GRU units, into the model. The bi-directional massage passing on the computation graph follows the topological order of the circuit graph.

*Giacomo Medda, Francesco Fabbri, Mirko Marras, Ludovico Boratto, Mihnea Tufis, Gianni Fenu*

*Arxiv 2023*

This paper introduces a GNN-based method for identifying and modifying the unfairness in recommendation, where the user-item interactions are represented as a bipartite graph. It proposes a graph perturbation mechanism to alter the user-item interactions. The edges to be perturbed are selected with a loss function that combines: (1) minimizing the absolute pair-wise difference across demographic groups, and (2) minimizing the distance between the original adjacency matrix and the perturbed one.

*Tiandeng Wu, Qijiong Liu, Yi Cao, Yao Huang, Xiao-Ming Wu, Jiandong Ding*

*AAAI 2023*

This paper proposes a GCN-based text classification method that can be applied for inductive inference on streaming data. It firstly fixes a universal token set (e.g., taken from PLM such as BERT). Then each document can be tokenized into a set of seen tokens. In this way, a token-document graph can be built, where edge weights are dynamically computed based on tf-idf.

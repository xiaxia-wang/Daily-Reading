This paper proposes a GCN-based text classification method that can be applied for inductive inference on streaming data. It firstly fixes a universal token set (e.g., taken from PLM such as BERT). Then each document can be tokenized into a set of seen tokens. In this way, a token-document graph can be built, where edge weights are dynamically computed based on tf-idf.

Semantic parsing is the task of translating natural language utterances to a formal meaning representation language. This paper applies schema matching to find correspondences between natural language words and ontological symbols, and uses pattern-based regression model to incorporate such pairs into the lexicon of the trained semantic parser. Here, a schema $S = (E, C, R, I)$ consists of an entity set $E$, a category set $C$, a relation set $R$, and an instance set $I$. Besides, such a standard semantic parsing model proposed in this paper can also make use of relevant information such as schema alignments. This paper also releases a dataset with 917 question-representation pairs for evaluation.

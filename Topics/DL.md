This paper proposes a method for concept learning in description logics. The task is, for a given knowledge base expressed in some description logic, a set of positive examples and a set of negative examples, to find a concept *C* which covers as many of the positive examples as possible, while covering as few negative examples as possible. It applies a new initialization method based on random walks, and also provides support for data properties. Typically, this kind of description logic learning methods are under the closed-world assumption.

This paper proposes a forgetting method for computing views of ontologies in SHQ. It is able to eliminate both concept names and role names, while being terminating and sound.

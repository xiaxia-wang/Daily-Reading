#### [Combining Global and Local Merges in Logic-based Entity Resolution](https://proceedings.kr.org/2023/74/)

*Meghyn Bienvenu, Gianluca Cima, Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto, Yazmín Ibáñez-García*

*KR 2023*

This paper is an extension of a previous rule-based entity resolution approach that only utilizes global merging of entities. To support both global and local merges, this paper introduces an extended approach where local merges may enable global merges and vice versa, and explores the computational properties of the resulting formalism.

#### [Tighter Bounds on the Expressivity of Transformer Encoders](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chiang23a.html)

This paper relates the expressivity of transformers to a logic called FOC[+; MOD], by characterizing the language that a transformer encoder recognizes.

#### [Faithful Embeddings for Eℒ++ Knowledge Bases](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-19433-7_2)

*Bo Xiong, Nico Potyka, Trung-Kien Tran, Mojtaba Nayyeri, Steffen Staab*

*ISWC 2022*

This paper proposes an embedding scheme for EL++ KBs. It models concepts in a KB as axis-parallel boxes, where entities are points inside the boxes. The relations are modeled as affine transformations between the boxes. In this way, it is able to express concept equivalence with intersection operator, and relations between boxes of different volumes.

*TheWebConf 2022*

This paper proposes a method for concept learning in description logics. The task is, for a given knowledge base expressed in some description logic, a set of positive examples and a set of negative examples, to find a concept *C* which covers as many of the positive examples as possible, while covering as few negative examples as possible. It applies a new initialization method based on random walks, and also provides support for data properties. Typically, this kind of description logic learning methods are under the closed-world assumption.

#### [Creating Signature-Based Views for Description Logic Ontologies with Transitivity and Qualified Number Restrictions](https://doi.org/10.1145/3485447.3511924)

*Yue Xiang, Xuan Wu, Chang Lu, Yizheng Zhao*

*TheWebConf 2022*

This paper proposes a forgetting method for computing views of ontologies in SHQ. It is able to eliminate both concept names and role names, while being terminating and sound.

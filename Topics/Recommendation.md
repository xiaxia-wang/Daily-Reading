This work explores to use LLM for recommendation by prompt distillation. Generally, recommendation requires user and item IDs as the input for the LLM, usually used as prompts. This paper proposes to learn a shorter dense vector as prompt to replace the original longer sparse prompt. Concretely, it appends a set of vectors at the beginning of an input sample that already filled in a discrete prompt template, and allow the vectors to be shared by the samples of the same recommendation task. It evaluates the proposed method for sequence recommendation, top-N recommendation, and generation of explanations.

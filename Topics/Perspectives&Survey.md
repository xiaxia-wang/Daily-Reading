#### [From Symbolic to Natural-Language Relations: Rethinking Knowledge Graph Construction in the Era of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09069)

*Kanyao Han, Yushang Lai*

*Arxiv 2026*

This position paper advocates moving from symbolic to natural-language relation descriptions, and proposes hybrid design principles that preserve a minimal structural backbone while enabling more flexible and context-sensitive relational representations.

#### [Large Language Models Meet Knowledge Graphs for Question Answering: Synthesis and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20099)

*Chuangtao Ma, Yongrui Chen, Tianxing Wu, Arijit Khan, Haofen Wang*

*EMNLP 2025*

This review categorizes the methodology of synthesizing LLMs and KGs for QA according to the categories of QA and the KG's role when integrating with LLMs, including complex QA, KGs as background knowledge, KGs as reasoning guidelines, KGs as refiners and validators, and advancements.

#### [Towards Faithfully Interpretable NLP Systems: How Should We Define and Evaluate Faithfulness?](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.386/)

*Alon Jacovi, Yoav Goldberg*

*ACL 2020*

The opinion proposed in this paper is two-fold: First, interpretability evaluation often conflates evaluating faithfulness and plausibility together. We should tease apart the two definitions and focus solely on evaluating faithfulness without any influence of the convincing power of the interpretation. Second, faithfulness is often evaluated in a binary “faithful or not faithful” manner, and we believe strictly faithful interpretation is a “unicorn” which will likely never be found. We should instead evaluate faithfulness on a more nuanced “grayscale” that allows interpretations to be useful even if they are not globally and definitively faithful.

#### [Not All Explanations for Deep Learning Phenomena Are Equally Valuable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23286)

*Alan Jeffares, Mihaela van der Schaar*

*ICML 2025*

This work argues that many prominent deep learning phenomena discussed in the research literature are not representative of challenges encountered in realworld applications of deep learning. Thus, not all efforts to understand these phenomena are equal in value – we should focus on using them to refine our broad explanatory theories of important aspects of deep learning rather than developing narrow ad hoc hypotheses to describe them in isolation. However, this perspective is not consistently reflected in current research practices within the community.

#### [ChatGPT is all you need to decolonize sub-Saharan Vocational Education](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13728.pdf)

*Isidora Tourni, Georgios Grigorakis, Isidoros Marougkas, Konstantinos Dafnis, Vassiliki Tassopoulou*

*ICLR 2023 Workshop*

This positional paper highlights the opportunity of using LLMs to improve the Technical and Vocational Educational Training (TVET) especially in some poverty-stricken areas such as sub-Saharan. It reviews some positive examples in history and discusses specific ways in which LLMs can be used in practice, in comparison to traditional academic trajectories.

#### [Modeling Spoken Information Queries for Virtual Assistants: Open Problems, Challenges and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13149.pdf)

*Christophe Van Gysel*

*SIGIR 2023 Short*

This paper discusses some open problems and challenges faced by automatic speech recognition of virtual assistants. Some related techniques, including query domain classification, knowledge graphs and user interaction data, and query personalization, can be helpful to improve the recognition of spoken information domain queries.

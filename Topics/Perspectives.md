#### [Not All Explanations for Deep Learning Phenomena Are Equally Valuable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23286)

*Alan Jeffares, Mihaela van der Schaar*

*ICML 2025*

This work argues that many prominent deep learning phenomena discussed in the research literature are not representative of challenges encountered in realworld applications of deep learning. Thus, not all efforts to understand these phenomena are equal in value â€“ we should focus on using them to refine our broad explanatory theories of important aspects of deep learning rather than developing narrow ad hoc hypotheses to describe them in isolation. However, this perspective is not consistently reflected in current research practices within the community.

*ICLR 2023 Workshop*

This positional paper highlights the opportunity of using LLMs to improve the Technical and Vocational Educational Training (TVET) especially in some poverty-stricken areas such as sub-Saharan. It reviews some positive examples in history and discusses specific ways in which LLMs can be used in practice, in comparison to traditional academic trajectories.

#### [Modeling Spoken Information Queries for Virtual Assistants: Open Problems, Challenges and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13149.pdf)

*Christophe Van Gysel*

*SIGIR 2023 Short*

This paper discusses some open problems and challenges faced by automatic speech recognition of virtual assistants. Some related techniques, including query domain classification, knowledge graphs and user interaction data, and query personalization, can be helpful to improve the recognition of spoken information domain queries.

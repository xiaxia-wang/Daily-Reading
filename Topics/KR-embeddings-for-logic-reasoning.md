This paper proposes a probabilistic embedding model for FOL queries over knowledge graphs. It implements a Gamma mixture method to alleviate the non-closure problem on union operators, and enables query embeddings to have strict boundaries on the negation operator.

This paper introduces a method for conjunctive queries over knowledge graphs. The input contains a set of anchor nodes, and the target is to get the embedding of the query variable. The conjunctive query is formulated as a DAG, and two transformation operators are learned for projection and intersection in the embedding space, respectively.

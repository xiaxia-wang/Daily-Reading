Machine unlearning refers to the ability of the learned model to forget information about specific training data as if they never existed in the training set. This paper follows the idea of approximate unlearning, whose goal is to forget the data to be forgotten while maintaining the performance. To achieve this, it optimizes the model to have similar behaviors on the data to be forgotten as unseen data, while maintaining the performance on the rest of data.

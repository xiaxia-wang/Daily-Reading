This is a vision paper by Facebook AI which proposes an idea of neural database. The motivation is that existing NLP techniques, especially transformers, can handle select-project-join queries which are expressed as short natural language sentences. Neural databases can base on that as a starting point to handle the data with pre-defined schema, though currently they cannot deal with set-based or non-trivial queries. It provides a set of examples to illustrate how the neural database works, strengthen the idea to "ground the vision" and reports some preliminary evaluation results. It also poses a research agenda with potential challenges in the future fulfillment of the comprehensive neural database system.

This paper introduces an algorithm to identify top-k similar record pairs from a large given corpus, which doesn't require a pre-defined similarity threshold. It is adapted from an existing similarity join algorithm named All-Pairs, by changing the current threshold while keeping top-k similar pairs, and devising a new stopping condition. In the experiment, this top-k join algorithm was compared with ppjoin-topk on several large datasets.

This paper analyses and discusses the general framework of Semantic Web user studies by reviewing 87 conference papers. The authors read and categorize the papers from 6 aspects, namely, (1) purpose, (2) users, (3) tasks, (4) setup, (5) procedure and (6) analysis and presentation of data. For each aspect, this paper presents the distributions of the reviewed paper with brief analysis. According to the analysis results, it also talks about an appropriate user study design for Semantic Web related systems, also following the six aspects/steps. Finally, it gives some suggestions and indicates challenges for conducting user studies in practice.

#### [From Natural Language Processing to Neural Databases](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3447689.3447706)

This is a vision paper by Facebook AI which proposes an idea of neural database. The motivation is that existing NLP techniques, especially transformers, can handle select-project-join queries which are expressed as short natural language sentences. Neural databases can base on that as a starting point to handle the data with pre-defined schema, though currently they cannot deal with set-based or non-trivial queries. It provides a set of examples to illustrate how the neural database works, strengthen the idea to "ground the vision" and reports some preliminary evaluation results. It also poses a research agenda with potential challenges in the future fulfillment of the comprehensive neural database system.

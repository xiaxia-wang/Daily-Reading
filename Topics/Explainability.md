This paper introduces PEACH, a tree-based explanation framework for text-based classification using pretrained contextual embeddings. Specifically, it obtains a pretrained embedding vector for each text document in the given corpus, then applies a feature extraction model (statistical or CNN-based) with decision tree algorithms to generate the tree-structured explanation.

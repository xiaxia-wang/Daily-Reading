This paper proposes a two-stage framework by using both structural and textual knowledge to learn rule-based KGC model. In the first stage, it computes a set of triples with confidence scores (called soft triples) from a text corpus by distant supervision. In the second stage, these soft triples are added into the given incomplete graph to jointly train a rule-based model for KGC.

This paper proposes a knowledge graph completion approach which is formulated as predicting a set of missing facts based on a set of given positive facts, without specifying any query such as (s, r, ?). It first proposes 3 classification metrics and 1 ranking metric, considering both the partial-open world and the closed-world assumptions. Then it applies an efficient subgraph-based method to predict the missing triple set.

This paper proposes a two-stage framework by using both structural and textual knowledge to learn rule-based KGC model. In the first stage, it computes a set of triples with confidence scores (called soft triples) from a text corpus by distant supervision. In the second stage, these soft triples are added into the given incomplete graph to jointly train a rule-based model for KGC.
